Hi, nice to meet you - my name is Cody Wilson. I am a self-taught remote frontend software developer living in Seattle, WA. Throughout my over seven year career, I have worked with a variety of tools and technologies to create numerous websites and applications on both the front and back end.

I've been enjoying and focusing more on frontend development in the last several years, and my preferred technologies are [:Icon{:name="tabler:brand-vue" .text-green-500} Vue], [:Icon{:name="tabler:brand-nuxt" .text-green-500} Nuxt], [:Icon{:name="tabler:brand-tailwind" .text-sky-300} TailwindCSS], and [:Icon{:name="tabler:brand-vite" .text-violet-500} Vite]. I have an in-depth knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including TypeScript), and love to design and build user interfaces.

When I'm not building software, I enjoy taking a stroll in one of the many beautiful parks in the Seattle area, grabbing a coffee or bite to eat at a new cafe or restaurant, and doodling in my sketchbook.
